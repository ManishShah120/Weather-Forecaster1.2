        ### HOW IT WORKS
        
        It prompts to select a state from the dropdown and then a city from that  state to get the forecast for and requests the forecast for the city's name that is taken as input and replaces the url with the one selected
        
        The source code of the requested webpage is decoded and `<div>` containing the forecast string is searched, manipulated a little, fomatted and is displayed.
